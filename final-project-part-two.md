# User Research and Interviews

## Target Audience

**Primary**: Pittsburgh residents aged 25-45 interested in buying/renting homes or understanding neighborhood development

Why this audience: This demographic is actively making housing decisions and needs data driven insights to evaluate neighborhoods. They might encounter real estate agents claiming “There’s Trader Joe’s down the neighborhood” and need to understand whether this phenomenon is real or myth, especially in Pittsburgh area.

**Secondary**: Real Estate Professionals and Urban Planning students

**What they are expecting from this story:**

- Clear answer to “Does proximity to Trader Joe’s affect home values?”
- Practical guidance for home-buying or home-renting decisions.
- Understanding of broader neighborhood development factors

## Interviewees

**Selection Criteria**: I recruited 3 individuals within my target audience to ensure diverse feedback.

**Recruitment Method**: Personal Network and CMU community

**Interviewee #1 Profile**: Student in Pittsburgh who is renting an apartment

**Interviewee #2 Profile**: Student in Pittsburgh who is renting an apartment

**Interviewee #3 Profile**: Non-US Resident who has extensive understanding in real estate

## Interview Script

*I'm working on a data story about the 'Trader Joe's Effect'—the idea that homes near Trader Joe's stores increase in value faster than other homes. I'm specifically testing whether this phenomenon holds true in Pittsburgh.*

*I'm going to show you my draft story in Shorthand. It's still a work in progress—some parts are finished, some are rough sketches. As you look through it, I'd love for you to think aloud. Tell me what you're noticing, what makes sense, what's confusing, what's interesting.*

## Question

### Initial Impressions

- **"What's your first reaction? What do you think this story is about?"**
- **"Does the opening grab your attention? Why or why not?"**
- **"Is anything confusing so far?"**

### Data Visualizations

- **"Walk me through what you see in this map/chart. What story does it tell?"**
- **"Is anything confusing or hard to understand in these visualizations?"**
- **"What additional information would help you interpret these charts?"**
- **For the control group: "Why am I comparing neighborhoods with and without TJ?"**

### Overall Assessment

- **"If you had to explain this project to a friend in one sentence, what would you say?"**
- **"What was the strongest part of the story?"**
- **"What was the weakest or most confusing part?"**
- **"Any other feedback or suggestions?"**
